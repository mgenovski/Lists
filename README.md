# Lists

IN PROGRESS...\
This is my project for SoftUni ReactJS course.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run server`

Runs the [SoftUni Practice Server](https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server).

### `npm run populate-data`

The [SoftUni Practice Server](https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server) does not save the data. This script populates the app with some data. **For presentation purposes only.**
